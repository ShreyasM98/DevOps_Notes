Version Control - Maintaining the back-up of the file where you made the changes.
Version control System - Which provides common location for merging code by various developers in the project.
We will not know who did the change, when the change was done and in which line of code/document the change was done.

Version Control - Version Control is a system that documents, the changes made to a file or a set of files. 
It allows multiple users to manage multiple revisions of the same unit of information.It is a snapshot of your project
overtime 

Some benefits of version control sysytem are:

1.Restoring Previous Versions.
2.Storing Versions.
3.Understanding what happened
4.Collaborating
5.Backing up


Version Control Systems

Local Version Control(LVC)
********************************************

1. The practice of having the Version Database in the local computer.
2.Local database keeps a record of the changes made to files in version database.

issue ---> What if multiple people parallely working on the same project

Solution ---> Centralized Version Control

Centralized Version Control(CVC)
*******************************************
Local Version Control's issues are resolved by Centralized Version Control.

In CVC, a central repository is maintained where all the versioned files are kept

Now users can checkout, and check-in files from their different computers at any time

issue - In case of central server failure whole system goes down.

solution - Distributed Version Control

Distributed Version Control
**********************************************
Distributed Version Control ---> Local Version Control System + Central Version Control System
Repository - location where you maintain your version of the file.
Using git you create a local repository
Using github you create a central repository

Version Database is stored at every user's local system and at the remote server.

Users manipulate the local files and the upload the changes to the remote server.

If any of the servers die, a client server can be used to restore.


Git
*************************************************
Git is an open-source Distributed Version Control Systems(DVCS) which reocords changes made to the files laying emphasis on speed, 
data integrity and distributed, non-linear workflows.

Why Git is a clear winner?

1.Snapshots - Git records the changes made to a file rather than file itself. That means if a filr isn't changed it isn't stored again.

2.Distributed - Every user has his own copy of the data in repository stored locally allowing full functionality even on disconnection.

3.Integrity - You can't make any changes to anything without Git recording that change.

4.Fast Operations - Almost every operation on git is local, hence the speed offerd by Git is lightning fast compared to other VCS's

5.Branch Handling - Every collaborator's working directory is in itself a branch. Different branches can be merged with ease.

6.Robust - Nearly every task in Git is undoable and it is really hard to lose any change or data in Git 

Git Commands
********************************************

To move from EC-2 instance to root user
sudo su -

yum - is a package for Amazon-Linux Tool or Redhat-Linux Tool

yum install git -y ---> command used to install git

git --version ---> command to check wheather the git is installed or not

git init ---> create a local repository for us

what is the folder that represents your local repository? .git folder

Which command creates a local repository? git init

git status ---> Helps us to check which change is version controlled , which change is not version controlled.

git add . ----> To add all the files to the staged area.

git add index1.html ---> To add the index1.html to the staged area.

# git commit -m "added file index1.html to LR" ---> which moves the files which are in the staging area to the Local Repository.

create mode 100644 index1.html --> 100644 is the  Permissions to the file.
