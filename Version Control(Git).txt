Version Control - Maintaining the back-up of the file where you made the changes.
Version control System - Which provides common location for merging code by various developers in the project.

Version Control Systems

Local Version Control(LVC)
********************************************

1. The practice of having the Version Database in the local computer.
2.Local database keeps a record of the changes made to files in version database.

issue ---> What if multiple people parallely working on the same project

Solution ---> Centralized Version Control

Centralized Version Control(CVC)
*******************************************
Local Version Control's issues are resolved by Centralized Version Control.

In CVC, a central repository is maintained where all the versioned files are kept

Now users can checkout, and check-in files from their different computers at any time

issue - In case of central server failure whole system goes down.

solution - Distributed Version Control

Distributed Version Control
**********************************************
Distributed Version Control ---> Local Version Control System + Central Version Control System
Repository - location where you maintain your version of the file
